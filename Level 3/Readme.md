## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict if a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
- **Data:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/)
- **Target:** `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy ~82.68%)
- **Key Skills:** Feature extraction (`Title` from `Name`), scaling, one-hot encoding, ensemble models.

---

### 2. Heart Disease Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health records.
- **Data:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Target:** `target` (1 = Disease Present, 0 = Absent)
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy ~87.5%)
- **Key Skills:** EDA, correlation heatmaps, feature scaling, voting classifiers.

### 3. Loan Approval Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan application will be approved.
- **Data:** [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
- **Target:** `Loan_Status` (Y = Approved, N = Rejected)
- **Best Model:** Voting Classifier (Soft Voting Accuracy ~84.4%)
- **Key Skills:** Missing value imputation, label encoding, pipeline design, saving/loading models.
